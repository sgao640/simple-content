## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and design for a generic content management system that supports multi-backend storage, versioning, preview generation, lifecycle events, and audit trails. The system is designed to be flexible, extensible, and integration-friendly with external systems handling access control (ACL).

## Objectives
- Store and manage content with metadata.
- Support storing content across multiple storage backends.
- Enable versioning of content objects.
- Allow preview generation for supported content types.
- Emit lifecycle events for system observability and async processing.
- Track audit trails for create, update, and access actions.
- Delegate access control (ACL) to external systems.

## Core Concepts

### Content
- Identified by an externally supplied `content_id` (UUID).
- Can have multiple versions.
- Each version can be stored in one or more storage backends.

### Derived Content
- We need to be able to create derived content from an existing content, existing content can be either original content or another derived content.
- For now, we only support up to 5 level of derived content.

### Object
- Represents the actual binary stored in a storage backend.
- One content version may have multiple associated objects (across backends).

### Metadata
- **Content Metadata**: General attributes (e.g., source system, filename).
- **Object Metadata**: Backend-specific or technical attributes (e.g., content type, checksum).

### Preview
- Previews are generated asynchronously for supported types.
- Multiple types of previews are supported (image thumbnail, PDF render, etc.).

### Audit Trail
- Captures create, update, access events.
- Stores actor identity, timestamp, and optional metadata.

### Lifecycle Events
- Published on a message bus (e.g., Kafka, NATS, or SQS).
- Used to trigger preview generation, cleanup, notifications, etc.

## Lifecycle

### Content
- **`created`**: Initial state after `POST /content` (or `CreateContent`). The record exists with metadata but no binary yet. For originals the `derivation_type` is `original`. For derived entries it reflects the requested category (for example `thumbnail`).
- **`uploaded`**: Reached when at least one associated object has been successfully uploaded and reconciled via `CompleteUpload`/`UpdateObjectMetaFromStorage`. The server writes object metadata (size, MIME type) back to the content metadata record and flips the status.
- **`deleted`**: Soft delete recorded by `DELETE /content/{id}`. The row remains for audit/history, `deleted_at` is set, and downstream callers should ignore the content. Objects retain their own lifecycle and must be cleaned up separately if hard deletion is required.

Content upload flow:
1. Create the content (`created`).
2. Create an object placeholder bound to that content (object enters `created`).
3. Upload bytes through a direct upload endpoint or presigned URL.
4. Call the completion endpoint so the service refreshes metadata from storage and promotes the content to `uploaded`.

### Derived Content
- Created through `POST /content/{id}/derived` or `CreateDerivedContent` with a parent ID.
- Starts in `created` while the derived asset is being produced. The relationship row stores the normalized `variant` (e.g., `thumbnail_256`) plus any `derivation_params`.
- When the derived object's upload completes, invoke the same completion flow as originals so the derived content reaches `uploaded`. This keeps parent and derived contents aligned, and allows list APIs to distinguish which variants are ready.
- A derived content can itself become a parent (up to the configured depth limit), enabling multi-step pipelines. Deleting a derived content only affects that branch; the parent remains untouched unless you explicitly remove the relationship.

### Object
- **`created`**: Set by `CreateObject`; no bytes stored yet, but the logical key/version are reserved.
- **`uploading`** *(optional)*: Clients may set this if they manage long-running uploads; the built-in flows transition straight from `created` to `uploaded`.
- **`uploaded`**: Set after the blob store confirms persistence and metadata is synchronized. This transition also drives the parent content to `uploaded` when it is the first successful object.
- **`processing` / `processed`**: Reserved for asynchronous post-upload jobs such as preview or transcode generation. Emit lifecycle events when entering/exiting processing so workers can react.
- **`failed`**: Marks an object that could not be processed. Keep the status to avoid retry loops without operator input.
- **`deleted`**: Soft delete for objects; set when logical removal is requested. Physical deletion from the blob store depends on backend policy.

Upload responsibilities:
- The repository guarantees idempotent status updates; the service always stamps `UpdatedAt` and writes fresh metadata snapshots.
- Blob stores must populate size, ETag, and MIME type so the caller can validate the upload.
- Applications that rely on presigned URLs should still call the completion endpoint; otherwise the object may remain in `created` and the content stuck in `created`.

Derived output tips:
- Run the derived pipeline after the source content reaches `uploaded` to ensure stable inputs.
- Store any derivation parameters (resize targets, codecs) in `derivation_params` so you can reproduce the asset.
- When derived processing finishes, create/upload an object under the derived content just like an original, then update the relationship metadata (for example processing duration) if needed.


## Data Model

### Tables

\`\`\`sql
-- Logical content entity
content {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  owner_id UUID,
  tenant_id UUID,
  status TEXT
}

-- Custom metadata for a content
content_metadata {
  content_id UUID FK,
  metadata JSONB
}

-- Physical object stored in a backend
object {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id UUID FK REFERENCES content(id),
  storage_backend_id UUID FK REFERENCES storage_backend(id),
  version INT DEFAULT 1,
  object_key TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
}

-- Metadata about the object (e.g., checksum, mime type)
object_metadata {
  object_id UUID FK REFERENCES object(id),
  metadata JSONB
}

-- Preview generated from an object
object_preview {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  object_id UUID FK REFERENCES object(id),
  preview_type TEXT,
  preview_url TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
}

-- Configurable storage backends
storage_backend {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE,               -- e.g. 's3-us-west'
  type TEXT,                      -- ENUM: 's3', 'gcs', 'azure', 'local'
  config JSONB,                   -- e.g. bucket, region
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
}

-- Event log for audits
audit_event {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id UUID FK REFERENCES content(id),
  object_id UUID FK REFERENCES object(id),
  actor_id UUID,
  action TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
}

-- Optional access log
access_log {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id UUID FK REFERENCES content(id),
  actor_id UUID,
  method TEXT,
  storage_backend TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP

## APIs

### Content Interface
- `POST /content` → Create content
- `GET /content/{id}/upload-url` → Get upload URL
- `PUT /content/{id}/metadata` → Update metadata
- `GET /content/{id}/metadata` → Get metadata
- `GET /content/{id}/preview` → Get preview URL
- `GET /content/{id}/download` → Get download URL
- `DELETE /content/{id}` → Delete content

### Storage Interface
- `GET /object/{id}/upload-url`
- `GET /object/{id}/download-url`
- `POST /object/{id}/upload`
- `GET /object/{id}/download`
- `GET /object/{id}/metadata`
- `PUT /object/{id}/metadata`

## External ACL Integration
- Identity propagated via headers (`x-user-id`, `x-tenant-id`, etc.).
- Ownership fields (`owner_id`, `tenant_id`) stored in DB.
- External systems responsible for enforcing access rights.

## Optional Enhancements
- Retention policies / TTL
- Soft delete with purge logic
- Tagging / labeling
- Quota enforcement
- Deduplication by content fingerprint
- Chunked uploads for large files

## Deployment Considerations
- Deploy preview workers as a queue consumer.
- Use observability tools to track lifecycle events and failures.
- Scale storage backend interface using adapter pattern.
