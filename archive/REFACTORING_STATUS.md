# Refactoring Status: simple-content

## Completed ✅

### Phase 1: Foundations
- ✅ Created `/pkg/simplecontent` package with core library
- ✅ Moved domain types (Content, Object, StorageBackend, etc.) to `pkg/simplecontent/types.go`
- ✅ Defined `Service` interface, DTOs, and typed errors in separate files
- ✅ Introduced functional options pattern (`WithRepository`, `WithBlobStore`, etc.)

### Phase 2: Interfaces
- ✅ Defined `BlobStore` interface for storage backends
- ✅ Moved memory storage implementation to `/pkg/simplecontent/storage/memory`
- ✅ Defined `Repository` interface for data persistence
- ✅ Moved DB code structure to `/pkg/simplecontent/repo/postgres`
- ✅ Created `/pkg/simplecontent/repo/memory` for testing

### Phase 3: Service Layer
- ✅ Implemented orchestration in `service_impl.go` with use cases for content and objects
- ✅ Added idempotency handling and status transitions
- ✅ Integrated event system and preview generation interfaces

### Phase 4: HTTP Server (Partially)
- ✅ Created example HTTP server in `/cmd/server/main_new.go` that uses library only
- ✅ Demonstrated clean separation between HTTP layer and business logic

## Architecture Overview

The refactored architecture now follows these principles:

```
pkg/simplecontent/
├── types.go           # Domain types (Content, Object, etc.)
├── service.go         # Main Service interface  
├── service_impl.go    # Service implementation
├── interfaces.go      # All interfaces (Repository, BlobStore, EventSink, etc.)
├── requests.go        # Request/Response DTOs
├── errors.go          # Typed errors
├── repo/
│   ├── memory/        # In-memory repository for testing
│   └── postgres/      # PostgreSQL repository
└── storage/
    └── memory/        # In-memory storage for testing
```

## Usage Examples

### As a Library
```go
repo := memoryrepo.New()
store := memorystorage.New()

svc, _ := simplecontent.New(
    simplecontent.WithRepository(repo),
    simplecontent.WithBlobStore("memory", store),
)

content, _ := svc.CreateContent(ctx, simplecontent.CreateContentRequest{
    OwnerID: uuid.New(),
    TenantID: uuid.New(),
    Name: "My Document",
})
```

### As a Server
```go
// Server constructs service and exposes HTTP API
svc := buildService()
server := NewHTTPServer(svc)
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", server.Routes())
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between domain, interfaces, and implementations
2. **Pluggable Design**: Easy to swap repositories (memory ↔ postgres) and storage backends  
3. **Testable**: In-memory implementations perfect for unit testing
4. **Library-First**: Can be embedded in other applications
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive error types and request/response DTOs
6. **Extensible**: EventSink and Previewer interfaces for future expansion

## What's Working

- ✅ Basic content and object management
- ✅ Memory storage backend
- ✅ Memory repository implementation  
- ✅ PostgreSQL repository structure
- ✅ Functional options pattern
- ✅ Error handling with typed errors
- ✅ Example usage in `examples/basic/`
- ✅ Build verification passes

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Phase 5: Config & Options
- [ ] Add configuration management for server mode
- [ ] Environment variable support
- [ ] Database connection configuration

### Phase 6: Additional Backends  
- [ ] Implement `storage/fs` (filesystem storage)
- [ ] Implement `storage/s3` (S3-compatible storage)
- [ ] Support presigned URLs

### Phase 7: Repository Improvements
- [ ] Add SQL migrations in `/migrations`
- [ ] Adopt `sqlc` for PostgreSQL queries
- [ ] Complete PostgreSQL implementation

### Phase 8: Extensibility
- [ ] Implement `noop` EventSink and Previewer
- [ ] Fire lifecycle events (`ContentCreated`, `ObjectUploaded`, etc.)
- [ ] Preview generation system

### Phase 9: Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests with Docker Compose
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 10: Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] More usage examples
- [ ] Migration guide from old structure

## Summary

The refactoring successfully transformed the `simple-content` project from a tightly-coupled server application into a clean, reusable Go library. The new architecture provides excellent separation of concerns, testability, and extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility concepts through the HTTP server wrapper.

The core library is now ready for use and can be easily extended with additional storage backends, repository implementations, and features as needed.
